# IT326-LiverDisease-Prediction

**Project Description:**
This project focuses on predicting liver disease using medical and lifestyle attributes such as age, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking, and other health indicators.
The main objective is to classify patients into two categories: Healthy or Diagnosed with Liver Disease. In addition, clustering methods are applied to group similar patients and identify hidden patterns in liver-related risk factors.

**Project Motivation:**
We selected this dataset because liver disease is a serious global health concern. Early prediction can support doctors and patients by providing the chance for early treatment and preventive steps.
